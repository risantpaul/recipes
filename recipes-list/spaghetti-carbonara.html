            <li>3 1/2 Ounces of Slab Guanciale, Pancetta, or Bacon,  sliced into

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place a large pot of lightly salted water (no more than 1 
                tablespoon salt) over high heat, and bring to a boil. Fill 
                a large bowl with hot water for serving, and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolks and pecorino 
                and Parmesan. Season with a pinch of salt and generous black 
                pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set the water to boil. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet 
                over medium heat, add the pork, and saut√© until the fat just 
                renders, on the edge of crispness but not hard. Remove from 
                heat and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add pasta to the water and boil until a bit firmer than al 
                dente. Just before pasta is ready, reheat guanciale in skillet, 
                if needed. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain pasta and 
                add to the skillet over low heat. Stir for a minute or so.
            </li>
            <li>
                Empty serving bowl of hot water. Dry it and add hot pasta mixture. 
                Stir in cheese mixture, adding some reserved pasta water if needed 
                for creaminess. Serve immediately, dressing it with a bit of 
                additional grated pecorino and pepper.
            </li>
        </ol>
