        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>Prep Soondae</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a pot of water up to boil. Don't take the Soondae out 
                the plastic package. Add it directly into the boiling water. 
                Boil for 5 minutes. Then turn off the heat. Give it another 
                5 minutes to simply sit in the water and steam. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully take the Soondae out of the package. Let it cool 
                down. Then use a knife and cut into small bite-sized pieces. 
                Sample one - it's ok to eat by itself and a dab of salt. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Prep Veggies and Make Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Julienne your onion and carrot into thin slices. Then roughly 
                dice the piece of cabbage. Roll-up the perilla leaves, tear 
                off its stems and julienne into thin pieces. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, take out a mixing bowl and thoroughly mix: Gochugaru 
                (2T), Gochujang (1T), Soy Sauce (2T), Sugar (Â½T), Honey (1T), 
                Maesil (1T), Minced Garlic (1T), Sesame Oil (1T), Sesame Seeds 
                (1T), Black Pepper (few shakes). 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Make Soondae Bokkeum</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place frying pan on a medium-high heat. Once its hot, place in 
                some oil. Then add in the cabbage, onions, and carrots. 
                Stir-fry until the cabbage and onions turn soft. It should take 
                about 4-5 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Once cabbage turns translucent and soft, add in the sundae. Then 
                add in all of the spicy marinade sauce. And reduce your heat to 
                a medium-low (!) Then stir-fry everything and get it nicely 
                coated. After 1-2 minutes, turn off heat. Add on some of the 
                sliced perilla leaves for color. You can also sprinkle-on some 
                perilla seeds powder (if you have it). Give it one final stir 
                and plate. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Garnish with the rest of the sliced perilla leaves on top. 
                Bon Appetit!
