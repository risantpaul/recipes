        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and 
                garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed 
                tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season 
                with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 
                teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, 
                covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook 
                lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain 
                noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine 
                ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon 
                salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of 
                a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over 
                meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. 
                Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups 
                meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan 
                cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and 
                Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either 
                spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not 
                touch the cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an 
                additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.

        </ol>
